# ScholarMode
A learning platform for YouTube

We've created a chrome-extension that enables students to ask and answer questions right next to the video.

## Tech stack
The extension is built with the MERN stack

## Steps to build and Load extension

1. run `yarn install` //installs dependencies
2. run `yarn build:extension` //compiles react into production-ready code
3. Inside the terminal, move to server directory & run `app.js`
4. open chrome://extensions/
5. load unpacked >> choose the build folder (generated by step 1)
6. Open YouTube and try it out

## To test any changes

1. save all changes and run `yarn build:extension`
2. reload extension from chrome://extensions/ and start testing
